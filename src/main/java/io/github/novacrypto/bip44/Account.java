 * different accounts.
 * <p>
 * Users can use these accounts to organize the funds in the same fashion as bank accounts; for donation purposes
 * (where all addresses are considered public), for saving purposes, for common expenses etc.
 * <p>
 * Accounts are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner. This number is used as child index in BIP32
 * derivation.

 * Hardened derivation is used at this level.
